          <p>A Trigger Point is a hyper sensitive area in muscular tissue that you can often feel as a nodule.
          Upon compression this area will be painful locally, and can cause pain that is felt elsewhere in the body,
          this is called a referred pain pattern.  This is useful when tracking down the source of pain, as once
          compressed you will feel the pain radiate to the affected referral area.

        <div className='about-paragraph-2'>
          <p>You should not be too focused on finding a nodule as they are often smaller than youâ€™d imagine,
          and instead focus on the area itself feeling tender to the touch, and causing a referral pain pattern
          to occur, this will give confirmation that you are in the correct area.
